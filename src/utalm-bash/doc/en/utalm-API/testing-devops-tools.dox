* \page testdevopstools How to test small sized adhoc-tools
* \brief How to test sysadmin tools
*  \par
*
 * The daily business of system administrators requires frequently the development
 * of small utilities for minor operation tasks. Even though each of 
 * this is actually small sized, the sum of the environment collection may not be. 
 * Therefore some efficient and less effort based tool set is required in oder
 * to assure quality and stability. This could be perfectly managed with a slim
 * Makefile based environment, which also includes appropriate rule-sets for
 * some popular documentation automation tools.
 *
 * The specific support of the trace and logging facility of UTALM provides here for 
 * a simple interface to store and manage the tools data for later test automation.
 * This enables the simplified application by writing the runtime data of the utility 
 * with a simple statement similar to the syntax of the applied language like
 *
 *	assertRefDataWithExit(lineno, filename, ID, data)
 *
 * All to be done for the storage of reference data collected on the fly is to set
 * the lag
 *
 *	TESTMODE=CREATEREF
 *
 * which changes to write-storage-mode for later comparison. This creates a mirror of
 * the subtree and writes the reference data literally into a file.
 
  by setting a flag
 *
 *	COMPAREREF
 *
 * No additional code or action is required. The main benefit here is the 
 * availability for may languages and environments with almost the same syntax.
 * Thus once the whole tool set is learned for one language, the latter are almost
 * known.
