/**
* \page unittestsbymake Unit-Tests with make
* \brief The make utility could be easily utilized for unit tests of command line utilities
*  \par
*
 * The make utility is designed to process system trees and execute 
 * operations based on predefined rules. This fits also to setting up a
 * file system based unit and regression test environment for small sized utilities
 * with less configuration effort. These requirements are typically present in the 
 * systems administration and DevOPs environments, also in development and test environments.
 *
 * Another requirement is given by heterogeneous landscape of nowadays toolsets 
 * covering almost all major programming languages and applied technologies.
 * Therefore this project focuses on providing a lean environment with simple and
 * efficient facilities for setting up a low-cost and low-effort development and
 * test environment for collecting all adhoc utilities developed in an agile 
 * work environement.
 *
 * This is provided by the utalm-bash component, which actually contains support 
 * for make and awk too. The main part is a combined trace and logging library, 
 * which enables a configurable standard output format for multiple programming languages.
 * This also includes a standard response format for application of test automation
 * of unit and regression tests.
