*
 * The daily business requirements particularly for systems administration
 * require frequently the development of micro utilities. Even though each of 
 * this is actually small sized, the sum of the environment collection may not be. 
 * Therefore some efficient and less efford based toolset is required in oder
 * to assure quality and stability. This could be perfectly managed with a slim
 * Makefile based environemnt, which also includes appropriate rulesets for
 * some popular documentation automation tools.
